# Taxi Origin-Destination Demand Prediction


This is a Tensorflow implementation of **[Contextualized Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Origin-Destination Demand Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8720246)** published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. In this paper, we present a challenging and worth-exploring task, called taxi origin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting the taxi demand between all-region pairs in a future time interval. We address this problem with a novel contextualized spatial-temporal network (CSTN), which consists of three components for the modeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context (TEC), and global correlation context (GCC), respectively.
